#3:
    For each iteration of the for loop , process 0 currently sends to each
    other process for a total of size-1 sends. We are running the program with
    8 processes, so there are 7 sends for each iteration.

#4:
    If broadcasts were used instead of sends, each iteration would do
    log2(size) sequential communication steps. Because we are using 8
    processes, we have 3 sequential communication steps.

#5:
    Because P2P takes 7 steps, and broadcast takes 3 steps, the program should
    run in 3/7 the time if we use broadcasts.
    
    2.719s * (3/7) = 1.165s

    So we can expect the broadcasting version of the program to run in 1.165s.
